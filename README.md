# LYNXgwas Server

**This is the online, multi-user edition of LYNXgwas.** It is maintained separately from the
desktop app (`LYNXgwas`) and differs from it in these ways:
- accounts with email-verified sign-up,
- private projects that are deleted automatically 15 days after creation,
- read-only public datasets,
- no AI agent,
- no access to server file paths.

- Plan and design: [`docs/SERVER_PLAN.md`](docs/SERVER_PLAN.md)
- Security model: [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md)
- Deployment (self-contained package, no Java installation needed): [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md)

```sh
scripts/package-server.sh linux-x64 /path/to/linux-jdk-17.0.10   # -> dist/lynxgwas-server-linux-x64.tar.gz
./run_tests.sh                                                   # includes ServerSecurityTest + ServerHttpTest
```

The rest of this README describes the analysis features, which are shared with the desktop app.

A local GWAS visualization and fine-mapping platform. Point it at your GWAS summary statistics
and it identifies loci, recovers rsIDs, computes LD, runs a full fine-mapping suite, and gives you
an interactive Manhattan/LD/gene-track viewer per locus — all in your browser, entirely on your
own machine, with no cloud account or upload step involved. It also includes a built-in AI Agent
that can drive the same actions through natural language, running against a fully local model by
default — see [How it works](#how-it-works) below for exactly what stays local and what doesn't.

## How it works

![LYNXgwas architecture: local-first pipeline with an opt-in AI Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlsammanAlsamman/LYNXgwas/main/docs/images/architecture_overview.png)

Everything — the pipeline, all six analysis modules, and the AI Agent itself when run against a
local model (e.g. [Ollama](https://ollama.com), one click away in the Agent settings panel) — runs
inside your own machine. The **only** way anything leaves it is if you explicitly configure the AI
Agent with a cloud API key, in which case your prompts and whatever project data the agent looks up
on your behalf (gene names, p-values, etc.) go to that provider, same as pasting them yourself. This
is a real trade-off, stated plainly rather than glossed over: use a local model if you don't want any
project data ever leaving your machine, full stop.

## Why LYNXgwas

Going from a raw GWAS summary-statistics file to a set of well-characterized, fine-mapped loci
usually means stitching together several separate tools by hand — a clumping step, a liftover or
rsID lookup, a manual LD calculation, one-off scripts for each fine-mapping method, and finally
some plotting code to actually look at the result. LYNXgwas wraps that whole workflow into one
local application with a UI: define a project once, and loci identification, LD, annotation, and
fine-mapping all run through the same pipeline and land in the same interactive viewer — including
comparing the same locus across multiple GWAS datasets, and cross-ancestry fine-mapping across
projects at once.

*Screenshots use real public data: the [PGC3 schizophrenia GWAS](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19426775)
(Trubetskoy et al. 2022, [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04434-5)) at the well-known
CACNA1C locus (lead SNP rs2238057, p=8.5×10⁻²²), with LD from the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 EUR panel
and gene annotation from GENCODE.*

## Install

```bash
pip install lynxgwas
```

Requires a Java 11+ runtime on your machine ([Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) is a good source
if you don't have one).

## Quick start

```bash
lynxgwas
```

This starts the local server and opens `http://localhost:8765/` in your browser. On first run it
will ask for (or offer to download) two things the pipeline needs:

- **PLINK 1.9** — for LD computation and reference-panel subsetting (`--plink <path>` to skip the prompt)
- **A GENCODE GFF3 annotation** — for the gene track (`--gff3 <path>` to skip the prompt)

Both are remembered afterward. From the home page, use **+ New project** to point LYNXgwas at
your own GWAS summary statistics and walk through the setup wizard.

## What it does

**Loci & annotation**
- Automatic loci identification from GWAS summary stats via PLINK clumping (or supply your own `loci.txt`)
- rsID recovery from a local dbSNP VCF, with optional NCBI/gnomAD API completion for anything left unmatched
- Gene-track annotation from a GENCODE GFF3, with nearest-gene lookup outside the plotted window
- Custom annotation tracks from your own TSV files (point/bar/flag styles) via an in-viewer wizard
- Genome-wide QC triage: genomic inflation factor (λ<sub>GC</sub>), with an optional LDSC-intercept comparison to separate genuine polygenicity from confounding

**LD & fine-mapping**
- LD computation and pairwise LD triangles per locus (PLINK reference-panel subsetting under the hood)
- **SuSiE** — Bayesian sum-of-single-effects fine-mapping with credible sets
- **FINEMAP**-style Wakefield ABF fine-mapping for single-causal-variant loci
- **GCTA-COJO** — conditional & joint SNP selection with an automatic reliability/artifact check
- **coloc** — colocalization against a second trait's summary stats (PP.H0–H4)
- **GWAMA** — meta-analysis pass-through
- **SuSiEx** — cross-ancestry joint fine-mapping across multiple LYNXgwas projects at once
- **MAGMA** — gene-based and gene-set association

**Cross-dataset & regulatory**
- **Gene/Region Constellation** — compare the same gene or genomic region across many GWAS datasets
  and disease groups at once, with a one-way ANOVA on both significance and effect size, and
  co-significance links between genes reaching significance together
- **Regulatory-element integration** — stacked H3K27ac/H3K4me1/H3K4me3 ChIP-seq tracks per locus from
  public reference epigenomes, plus a real interval-overlap enrichment test against your project's
  own significant SNPs

**AI Agent**
- A built-in, tool-calling agent panel drives project creation, pipeline runs, and analysis tools
  through natural language, using either a local model (Ollama/LM Studio, with one-click small-model
  downloads) or a cloud API key you supply — see [How it works](#how-it-works) above for what each
  mode does and doesn't send off your machine
- Every action the agent takes is logged and shown as a visible step; it has no capability a human
  couldn't already trigger by clicking through the UI, and no delete/destructive actions at all

**Viewer & output**
- Interactive Manhattan plot, gene track, LD triangle, and regulatory tracks, all zooming together
- Live locus editing: resize, split, create, and reorder loci without re-running the whole pipeline
- Per-locus and whole-genome PDF export; full Excel export of all annotated SNPs
- Multi-project management from a single home page, with per-project staleness tracking
